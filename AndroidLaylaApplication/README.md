Here you can see my android application, which can be helpful in a therapy, for a person which suffers from depression.

It is a school project, however I've done the whole application apart from:
- translation
- mood recognition - I did it by using Facetracker project from Google.
- measuring blood pressure - I did it by using github project.
- menu icons
- fingeprint authentication - however, it's not contained in this version, but it is present in source code.

You can login with exemplary account.
